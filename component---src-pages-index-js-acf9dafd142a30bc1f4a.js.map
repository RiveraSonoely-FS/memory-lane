Despite facing setbacks and technical hurdles along the way, each obstacle has strengthened my resolve and deepened my \n            understanding of web technologies. I've learned to persevere through coding bugs, complex projects, and demanding deadlines, \n            knowing that overcoming these challenges will prepare me for a rewarding career in web development. With dedication and a \n            passion for learning, I am committed to achieving my goal of graduating and contributing to the future of digital innovation.\n          </p>\n        <h3>My Experience Building an API - Jul 14</h3>\n          <p>\n            Building an API from scratch was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It taught me how to connect the dots between front-end \n            and back-end development. I gained hands-on experience in handling databases, implementing CRUD operations, and managing data flow.\n\n            This journey also reinforced the importance of clear documentation and robust error handling, which are crucial for any developer \n            working with APIs. As I move forward in my studies, I feel more confident tackling complex projects and contributing to real-world applications.\n\n            In conclusion, building an API has been a foundational experience in my web development education. It has provided me with skills and knowledge \n            that will serve me well in my future career. If you’re a fellow student or just starting your coding journey, I encourage you to dive into API \n            development—it's an invaluable skill that will enhance your understanding of web applications.\n          </p>\n      </div>\n      <footer style={footerStyles}>\n        <p>© 2024 Developing Web Apps.
