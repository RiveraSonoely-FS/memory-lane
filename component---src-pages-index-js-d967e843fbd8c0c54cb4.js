A JWT is divided into three segments: the header, which specifies the token type and the signing algorithm; the payload, which contains the claims or data about the user; and the signature, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token. This compact structure allows JWTs to be efficiently passed through URLs or HTTP headers, making them a valuable tool in modern web development. In practice, JWTs are primarily used for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT that includes the user's information, which is then used in subsequent requests to verify the user's identity. JWTs can also include authorization claims to manage user permissions. Despite their advantages—such as being self-contained and reducing server-side storage requirements—JWTs require careful attention to details like token expiration and secret management to ensure robust security.")),a.createElement("footer",{style:s},a.createElement("p",null,"© 2024 Developing Web Apps.
